# DoMar's Dotfiles

Truly nothing that special. Just run the .install.sh script to install the items(files and scripts) I find most important when either setting up a new computer or using a different one for terminal work.

### For now, these items include...
+ .bashrc
+ .vimrc
+ .tmux.conf
+ .fScripts **(a directory)**
